<p>Here we are another week. This week's post will probably be short, since it was a bit of a crazy week.</p>

<h1>Great news</h1>

<p>First off, the great news. As you may know, we got a mention for Tankball in the Airconsole contest. That means we'll be a 100$ richer, but it also means extra motivation to finish the game, since it was in a game jam-ish state, having had only two days to work on it. You can check the winner and the full list of mentions <a href="http://blog.airconsole.com/2016/03/airconsole-game-developers-contest.html">here</a>. Additionally, they told us they think our game concept is cool and they'd like to have it published in their site.</p>

<h1>Bugfixing and polish</h1>

<p>As I just said, the game was not in a state to be released to the public yet, but of course we want it to be there. With that in mind, the next obvious step is to fix what is broken and polish what is not broken but also not quite as good as it could. That is exactly what we have done during this week. We got together, discussed a few things, and started working. We have managed to fix a crash when a player connected to the game too soon, which was our biggest concern, and we have also started making adjustments and trying different things to address the problems we (and the AirConsole team, whom we thank for their feedback) had detected.</p>

<p>This week I don't have screenshots to share, nor a playable link yet, but we're getting there. We hope to finish the game and send the release version to AirConsole within the next weeks, so stay tuned!<p>

<h1>So, what's next?</h1>

<p>I think I'm going to keep this as a section, because it serves me to think on what I want to do the next week, and also as a kind of log to see how much I end up deviating from my original intentions. For now my prediction of devoting must (all, as a matter of fact) of my "useful free time" to Tankball has proven true, and I think it will probably be that way until we finish it. That said, I still keep the rest of projects in mind, and their time will hopefully arrive sooner than later.</p>

<p>That's all! Also, on a hundred percent off-topic and personal note, I want to mention that I'm kind of proud of myself for consistently working and posting, even if it's been only two weeks. I'm usually terrible at discipline and consistency when it comes to my free time, and this should be specially true now that I have started playing FFXIV with some old WoW friends.</p>
