<p>Hello there! This week's post will also be short. I also know I skipped last week's post, but since we are just doing bugfixing and little improvements, I don't have a lot of interesting things to talk about. </p>

<h1>Status update</h1>

<p>We keep working at Tankball, trying to make it great for launch. We have fixed the most worrying bugs and made some much needed improvements, introducing new bugs too. Some of the things we have been doing are: scaling the playing field depending on the number of players, getting better visual feedback when a player scores or kills another one, improved how shooting works and feels, and improved the controller. We have also done minor tweaks to other stuff. We still have a bunch of tasks to finish, and we will probably find some new ones before we are through, but I'm really hoping we have a final version soon.</p>

<p>As part of the status update, I'm sharing with you some new cover art Manu did recently, with the updated game. This is still not final, since we don't know if we will end up changing something else, but it's very likely that the game final version will look like this.</p>

<h1>An interesting bug</h1>

<p>We have one bug that has been driving me crazy, and in which I have spent a good amount of time. When we scale the field, some of the colliders seem to stop working, or start acting funny. I don't know what's the matter yet, but unless it turns out to be some stupid mistake (which I won't rule out at all), it may make for some interesting thing to say in my next post.<p>

<h1>So, what's next?</h1>

<p>Going forward, we are going to keep working on Tankball!, trying to get a finished version up and running on AirConsole. After launch I guess we will still have to work on it a bit, specially if crash/bug reports start arriving, but it will probably free up some time for other stuff. Until then I may do one post every two weeks, since as you can see I don't have a lot to tell, unless something interesting happens or I have some technical knowledge (like the bug I mentioned) to share.</p>

<p>That's all! On the personal note of today, I'm not proud for skipping a week but I'm not surprised, I have a hard time being consistent with my personal projects, as I said. Also, after trying for a while I finally decided that I don't have the time or the schedule to properly play and enjoy FFXIV, so there goes, another abandoned game in my Steam library. This should be more free time, but I have started working out a couple of days a week, and I'm always playing some thing or another, so yeah... time's still tight. Jorge out!</p>
