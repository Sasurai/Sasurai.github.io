<h1 class="entry-title">About me</h1>
<div class="entry-content" style="float: left">
I'm Jorge Martinez Vargas. I'm (quite obviously) not a web developer, although I managed to set this up.

Anyways, I'm a programmer, I love games and I've been working on them since I finished my degree, first in a mobile gaming company and now porting them. I also try to use some of my free times to try out game ideas of my own, learn useful stuff and whatnot. And of course a big part of my free time is used on gaming, mostly on PC.

I will update this when I have more interesting stuff to tell, or to brag about... like, when some of the games I'm working on porting gets released, or when finish a worthwile game on my free time.
